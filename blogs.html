         <!-- topic here -->
                  I'am ASMAE , 22 y.o , a data science student . My today's Blog is about Self-dicipline and I'm 
blogging to share my personal experience with all readers.
Today I'm talking about a topic that strongly influenced my life and it's been a while since I've
been trying to fix what I'm doing. It's SELF-DICIPLINE and MANAGING TIME.
In Fact , I was Lying to myself , I started many projects , many online courses and found out later
that all what I did was just starting without finishing any kind of work . Actually , I thought
the main reason was wasting time in meaningless things like having "empty" conversations and talks
, spending the whole time using my phone . Literaly I didn't want to get out of my confort zone
, I was deceiving myself by saying that ' the time you wasted enjoying wasn't wasted'. But I realised
that it wasn't that kind of enjoyment . Moreover , I really suffered from that life im putting 
myself into it. I don't want you to say that i don't believe in myself , but totally the opposite
of that , I strongly trust myself and I know that I have a great potential to do great things
and that's why I'm striving for excellence. I don't want to be Average! . If I had to sum up
I would say that all of successful people have self-dicipline and they are good at managing their
time . We all have 24h  but we are not living it the same . In a hand , having the ability to manage my
time and controle myself is  big deal for me . Without talking about motivation because motivation
can last 10min,1hour or 1 day and it can help to do either fun or easy things but when it comes to
difficult or unconfortable things it totally disappears , So in that time we need self-dicipline
to start and comittement to finish what we have started. In other hand , Life won't give me what
I want , it will give me what I deserve and I deserve the best . Believing that If I haven't sacrified for
it and i haven't given my all , I won't get it .
Finaly , I remain faithful to myself, and my vision , also all my goals for this year will be
acheived. See you in the next Blog! Thanks for reading

          <h5 class="font-weight-medium mt-3"><a class="link text-decoration-none">Is hard for you too , being specific ?</a></h5>
          <p class="m-t-20">nowadays no one from us except some ones who are specific , that means being interested in one subject, field or sepciality .
          For me this sense of perplexity may conduct us doing things without mastering and love .
          No one can deny that on some day the others will discover you , what you prefer and master and that what will reflect the real you , your brain power and skills , so for such situation experts suggest for you a lot of advices to avoid this sense of non responsability let's resume what we said seeing these specific quotes. <br /> <br />
          “Understanding” may become “misunderstanding”, if no commitment or no responsibilities are assumed, no specific objectives set, no definite expectations met and common values and interests no longer shared. <br />
              <em style="font-weight:bold"> Erik Pevernagie </em>
          <br /> <br />
          “I have discovered that you will achieve nothing if you pursue everything. Be specific and stay focused.” <br />
              <em style="font-weight:bold"> Israelmore Ayivor, Become a Better You </em>
           <br /> <br />
           “People become wealthy when they become specific... when they know what that means to them, not only in terms of the objects and amounts involved - ... but also in terms of how they want this wealth to make them feel.” <br />
