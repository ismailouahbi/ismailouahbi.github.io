                                Until now, we&#39;ve discussed personality` tricks topics, let us continue and see how to be more organized and switching from a lazy person to a successful,motivated and influencer (not like those who call themselves &quot;influencers&quot;) person .<br />
                                  From the keys of success, organization appears telling us about life and personality changing.
                                No one can deny that on a day before you told yourself that you have the capability and the power enough to begin a new life, experience, and success but sadly without any planning or vision (I am not sure but someone will tell you that you were lying on yourself), Ok ! let it pass calmly, I will give you the key to planify your objectives and the rest is for you! <br />
                                Start by buying Block-Notes (a sticked piece of paper) like showes the picture below <br /><img class="card-img" src="blob:file:///61d12bf1-9e10-4a71-8a7e-e4b789af3ed6" alt="block note" /><br /><br />
                                Life is easy don&#39;t complicate it so, write what you want to do this day (tasks, gym, travel...) and start the process! <br />
                                Let me see your &quot;life-changing plan&quot; results by the end.

                            <p>

                                I&#39;am ASMAE , 22 y.o , a data science student . My today&#39;s Blog is about Self-dicipline and I&#39;m
                                blogging to share my personal experience with all readers.
                                Today I&#39;m talking about a topic that strongly influenced my life and it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve
                                been trying to fix what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s SELF-DICIPLINE and MANAGING TIME.
                                In Fact , I was Lying to myself , I started many projects , many online courses and found out later
                                that all what I did was just starting without finishing any kind of work . Actually , I thought
                                the main reason was wasting time in meaningless things like having &quot;empty&quot; conversations and talks
                                , spending the whole time using my phone . Literaly I didn&#39;t want to get out of my confort zone
                                , I was deceiving myself by saying that &#39; the time you wasted enjoying wasn&#39;t wasted&#39;. But I realised
                                that it wasn&#39;t that kind of enjoyment . Moreover , I really suffered from that life im putting
                                myself into it. I don&#39;t want you to say that i don&#39;t believe in myself , but totally the opposite
                                of that , I strongly trust myself and I know that I have a great potential to do great things
                                and that&#39;s why I&#39;m striving for excellence. I don&#39;t want to be Average! . If I had to sum up
                                I would say that all of successful people have self-dicipline and they are good at managing their
                                time . We all have 24h but we are not living it the same . In a hand , having the ability to manage my
                                time and controle myself is big deal for me . Without talking about motivation because motivation
                                can last 10min,1hour or 1 day and it can help to do either fun or easy things but when it comes to
                                difficult or unconfortable things it totally disappears , So in that time we need self-dicipline
                                to start and comittement to finish what we have started. In other hand , Life won&#39;t give me what
                                I want , it will give me what I deserve and I deserve the best . Believing that If I haven&#39;t sacrified for
                                it and i haven&#39;t given my all , I won&#39;t get it .
                                Finaly , I remain faithful to myself, and my vision , also all my goals for this year will be
                                acheived. See you in the next Blog! Thanks for reading

                    <h5 class="font-weight-medium mt-3"><a class="link text-decoration-none">Is hard for you too , being specific ?</a></h5>
                    <p class="m-t-20">Nowadays no one from us except some ones who are specific , that means being interested in one subject, field or sepciality .
                        For me this sense of perplexity may conduct us doing things without mastering and love .
                        No one can deny that on some day the others will discover you , what you prefer and master and that what will reflect the real you , your brain power and skills , so for such situation experts suggest for you a lot of advices to avoid this sense of non responsability let&#39;s resume what we said seeing these specific quotes. <br /><br />
                        “Understanding” may become “misunderstanding”, if no commitment or no responsibilities are assumed, no specific objectives set, no definite expectations met and common values and interests no longer shared. <br /><em style="font-weight: bold;"> Erik Pevernagie </em><br /><br />
                        “I have discovered that you will achieve nothing if you pursue everything. Be specific and stay focused.” <br /><em style="font-weight: bold;"> Israelmore Ayivor, Become a Better You </em><br /><br />
                        “People become wealthy when they become specific... when they know what that means to them, not only in terms of the objects and amounts involved - ... but also in terms of how they want this wealth to make them feel.” <br /><em style="font-weight: bold;"> Kiki Theo</em></p>
